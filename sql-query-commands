Statement	How to Use It	Other Details
SELECT	SELECT Col1, Col2, ...	Provide the columns you want
FROM	FROM Table	Provide the table where the columns exist
LIMIT	LIMIT 10	Limits based number of rows returned
ORDER BY	ORDER BY Col	Orders table based on the column. Used with DESC.
WHERE	WHERE Col > 5	A conditional statement to filter your results
LIKE	WHERE Col LIKE '%me%'	Only pulls rows where column has 'me' within the text
IN	WHERE Col IN ('Y', 'N')	A filter for only rows with column of 'Y' or 'N'
NOT	WHERE Col NOT IN ('Y', 'N')	NOT is frequently used with LIKE and IN
AND	WHERE Col1 > 5 AND Col2 < 3	Filter rows where two or more conditions must be true
OR	WHERE Col1 > 5 OR Col2 < 3	Filter rows where at least one condition must be true
BETWEEN	WHERE Col BETWEEN 3 AND 5	Often easier syntax than using an AND
